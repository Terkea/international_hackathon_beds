OK.  Just got up and have a pile to do.

I created that site using a bootstrap template but there is another called
IUSCH1

I was trying to encorporate the best features of both templates.

I created a DB called Hackathon to store universities, registrations, groups, and students in each group.

The idea is that a University first registers with contact details.  I have a list of possible Universities.

Then a student registers but only if the University has first registered.

Then a group is created for Universities that have registered

Then students sign up to a group.

FOUR STAGES

Then as each University registers they are displayed in a dynamic list. (Optional)

There really ought to be a Contact US section if students have queries

Also a way of downloading or displaying the scenarios.  I was going to make them accessible only to registered students but that is not necessary.
